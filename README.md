Hello, Guys this is my first project that I have uploaded to GitHub, I am still a beginner so any suggestions are welcome.
I have tried to make the code readable and easily understandable.
The format of CGPA or SGPA is applicable to my institution/college, this can and most definitely will vary from college to college. 
The code only checks if you have passed or failed in the Mandatory Subject and doesnot account it for the Theory subject. Therefore please enter the mandatory course details
in its designated place and do not add it to the number of theory courses.


Thank You.
